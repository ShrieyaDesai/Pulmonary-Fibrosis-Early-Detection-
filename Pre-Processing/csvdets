Band-Energy Features (band_0 … band_7)

These represent how energy is distributed across low–mid frequency ranges (100–2500 Hz).

Why useful for fibrosis:

Fibrosis lung sounds have high-frequency crackles (100–2000 Hz)

Normal lung sounds have lower-frequency dominant energy

These band energies help ML models differentiate crackles vs normal breath

✓ This is one of the best handcrafted features.
 2. Total Energy

Crackles and fibrosis sounds often have:

short bursts of higher spectral energy

more “spikey” energy in specific bands

This helps the model catch “fibrotic events”.

Spectral Centroid

This measures the "brightness" of the sound:

Higher centroid → more high-frequency content → common in fibrosis

Lower centroid → normal airflow sounds

Centroid is VERY predictive for pathological breath sounds
